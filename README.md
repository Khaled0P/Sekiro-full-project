# Sekiro-full-project

this project is about a game I chose because it has great artstyle and graphical content that will serve the design I was going for, plus it's easier to just choose a topic for your page and commit to it  


this took lots of effort and I defiinitely pushed my boundaries and stepped out of my comfort zone. and it was well worth it


inspired by the design of Criosyom from TOP (the Odin project)
